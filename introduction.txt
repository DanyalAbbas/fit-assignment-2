Hi there! I'm Danyal, a 17-year-old programmer with a passion for Python and a growing interest in Machine Learning. Despite being young, I've actively developed my programming skills for over 3 years, gaining experience in game development, computer vision, and data analysis. Driven by the power of data, I'm currently exploring Machine Learning and aspire to become a Data Scientist.
